**My first slightly bigger project with no training wheels.**



A stock and portfolio analysis website with a few functionalities:

**--Stock analysis tool:**

    - Look up companies/stocks and get information on their financials, financial ratios (P/E, beta, etc)

    - Compare up to 3 companies' financials at the same time

    - Ability to export that data onto a .csv file

**--Portfolio analysis tool:**

    - Build a portfolio by adding companies, ETFs, etc

    - Backtest the portfolio against the historical data

    - Get feedback about the portfolio. Sharpe ratio, standard deviation, comparison to the broad market (S&P500), max drawdown, etc.
